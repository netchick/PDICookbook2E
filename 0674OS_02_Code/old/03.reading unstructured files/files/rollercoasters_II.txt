Designed to be a miniature version of Mount Everest, the mountain this roller coaster ride is built on and within is nearly 200-feet tall and occupies a 6.2-acre site in the Asia section of Animal Kingdom. The story for the attraction is based on a legend that claims that high in the Himalayan Mountains lives an enormous creature that fiercely guards the route to Mount Everest. Now that legend comes dramatically to life in a new high-speed train adventure that combines coaster-like thrills with the excitement of a close encounter of the hairy kind. You can discover for yourself the fearsome legend of the yeti.

Expedition Everest is a freeform mine train roller coaster that reaches a top speed of 50 mph and plummets down an 80-foot drop from the summit. A unique switch track midcourse allows the 34-passenger trains to reverse directions so they may travel both forwards and backwards during the course of the ride.
